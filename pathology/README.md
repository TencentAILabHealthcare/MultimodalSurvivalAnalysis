# Code for Survival Analysis

## Code Description

Here we provide the main code of the paper method, including the neural network architecture design of the attention mechanism mentioned in the paper, the code of the training and testing part, the code of the attention visualization, and so on.

## Usage

In DatasetLoader.py, we provide the code to read pathological image features;
In model.py, we define the attention-based neural network used;
In evaluate.py, we provide the code to evaluate the neural network.

## Dataset

The dataset cannot be made public due to privacy concerns. We provide a patient's pathology images and a trained checkpoint for code inference and evaluation. More other data is available by contacting the authors. The pathological modality's survival risk can be obtained by running evaluate.py.
