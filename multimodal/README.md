# Code for Survival Analysis

## Code Description

Here we provide the code for survival analysis of patients using the multimodal method, which is mainly based on the basic statistical information of the patient and the risk information obtained from the pathological modality for survival analysis and prediction. The provided code mainly includes data preprocessing and loading, as well as training and prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset cannot be made public due to privacy concerns. We provide a patient's pathology images and a trained checkpoint for code inference and evaluation. More other data is available by contacting the authors. The pathological modality's survival risk can be obtained by running evaluate.py.
